Automatic Core Text Hyphenation
===================

Trying to add hyphenation for core text.

Features:
- Automatic hyphenation (finds where to cut words and adds a "-")
- Automatic sizing (if setted, the text view will grow as heigh as needed)
- Hightlighting (tap on the text to get the word tapped and its bounding box)
- Basic Markup

To do:
- Highlighting should work with hyphenated words too.
- More markup features
- Add localization options (right now its working in spanish)

Basic Core Text and Markup stuff based on the tutorial on raywenderlich.com (http://www.raywenderlich.com/4147/core-text-tutorial-for-ios-making-a-magazine-app)
